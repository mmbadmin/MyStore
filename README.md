Support for developing single page applications (SPAs) using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Fundamental requirements such as logging, authentication, and authorization to help developers quickly build and deploy SAP applications.
Utilization of .Net framework for building the backend and providing the necessary APIs for the SPA to communicate with the server.
Features: 
This framework is built on the .Net 5 platform and provides a number of features to help developers build efficient and scalable applications. One of the key features is Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which separates read and write operations in the system, allowing for better performance and scalability. Additionally, it includes logging capabilities to track and record system events, which is useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

Another feature of the framework is its user and role management system, which allows for the creation, modification, and management of users and their associated roles. This feature is useful for building applications that require user authentication and authorization.

A mediator pattern is also implemented in the framework, which allows for managing communication between different components of the system. This pattern is useful for implementing a centralized point of control and can help to improve the maintainability and testability of the code.

The framework also has built-in support for unit testing, which enables developers to test individual units of code to ensure they are functioning as expected. This feature helps to reduce the likelihood of bugs and errors in the final product.

Finally, the framework utilizes a CacheManager, which allows caching data and reduce the number of calls to the database and thus increasing the performance.
